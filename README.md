This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.

Number of Instances: 41188

Number of Attributes: 20 + output attribute.
Output variable (desired target):
  21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")
  
Data Set Information:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
